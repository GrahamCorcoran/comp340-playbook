# Welcome to the COMP340 Playbook!

The Playbook is available at https://comp340.grahamcorcoran.ca, and this GitHub repository is not a required part of the course. However, if you've found it and are interested in looking around, feel free!

## What's going on in here?

This Playbook is written using [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/), a CLI tool to create books with Markdown. Most of this repository is using the basic structure generated by mdBook automatically, and for the most part the only real configuration required on my end was setting up a [SUMMARY.md](https://github.com/GrahamCorcoran/comp340-playbook/blob/main/src/SUMMARY.md) file ([documentation](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/format/summary.html)).

In addition, I configured:

1. A [.gitignore file](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) to avoid committing the actual HTML files created by mdBook that get rendered on the webpage. Those files take up extra space for no reason since they need to be generated every time by mdBook, and committing them just adds unnecessary duplication. The markdown files are the source of truth! The rendering step is just "the output".
2. The [.github/workflows](https://github.com/GrahamCorcoran/comp340-playbook/tree/main/.github/workflows) directory which contains the deployment file. This is how the book gets deployed to "production". I did very little configuration of that file myself, as most of it was provided directly by the folks at mdBook via their [Automated Deployment](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/wiki/Automated-Deployment) reference material.
3. I added [mdbook-admonish](https://github.com/tommilligan/mdbook-admonish) and perhaps some other [preprocessors](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/format/configuration/preprocessors.html) depending on when you read this. mdBook relies on its plugins (preprocessors) to help keep things lightweight. There's no sense having every webpage bring in thousands of files worth of JavaScript when really you only ever plan to use a tiny fraction!
4. On the web-hosting side of things, I had to configure the comp340 subdomain to redirect to GitHub pages. The default domain for this book was actually [https://grahamcorcoran.github.io/comp340-playbook](https://grahamcorcoran.github.io/comp340-playbook), but I prefer to keep it easy to remember and comp340.myname.ca seemed easiest!

All in all, big shoutout to the folks at mdBook for the tool, and GitHub for GitHub Pages! This whole process was very simple and I was able to get the book online and hosted within an afternoon. Now all I have to do is edit the markdown files and push my changes and the rest is handled automagically!
