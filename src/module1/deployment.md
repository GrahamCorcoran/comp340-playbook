# Deployment

```admonish info
Want an example of a "live deployment pipeline?" Why not take a look under the hood at the [COMP340 Playbook](https://github.com/GrahamCorcoran/comp340-playbook)? In the GitHub repository you can see:

1. The use of [mdbook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/), a tool written by someone else to create this book. 
2. CICD Pipeline using GitHub Workflows in ./github/workflows
3. Handling of third-party dependencies: I wanted colourful "callouts" like you're reading now and the mdbook defaults weren't very good, so I installed [mdbook-admonish](https://github.com/tommilligan/mdbook-admonish).
