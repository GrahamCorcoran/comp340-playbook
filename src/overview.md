## Meet Your Professor
ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Graham! I'm a St. Lawrence College graduate, and I work in the industry as a Software Engineer. I have two cats and a dog, and I really enjoy teaching!

I got drawn to programming as the logical thinking and problem-solving required really works well for my brain, and I find it incredibly satisfying to finally crack a sneaky bug.
