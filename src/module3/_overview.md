# Dynamic Design
Dynamic Design focuses on how the system we are developing behaves over time. In contrast to static design which is describing the system and its relationships, dynamic design is describing the behaviour. This includes interactions, workflows, and runtime processes.

Sequence Diagrams from Module 2 are a good introductory concept to Dynamic Design. Over the course of this Module, we will also cover **Workflow Modeling**, **State Modeling** as two methods of communicating ideas specific to dynamic design. Further, we will dig into System Integration and Performance and Scalability.

By the end of this module, you should be able to make solid design decisions regarding the performance of the code you're writing. You should also be able to effectively communicate the basic concepts of interactivity in your programs.
